<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/eibiflo/cf_cookiemanager/)

There are many Cookie Extensions available on the market, however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I
created this enhanced one. I want to create an so amazing Cookie Manager that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I
think this is it.

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a Cookie Service from scratch

Of course, no extension is Perfect and will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more
Features in the near future.
